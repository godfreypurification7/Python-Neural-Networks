The Python-Neural-Networks repository aims to provide a foundational, from-scratch implementation of neural network functionality in plain Python. The codebase consists of several .py files which together implement various core building blocks: activation functions, layer and batch abstractions, loss functions (e.g., via cross-entropy), and at least one main network definition (neural.networks.py). Other modules — such as batches-layers-objects.py, batches-layers-objects2.py, implementing.loss.py, and cross.entropy.py — suggest a modular design where data handling, layer abstractions, and loss computation are separated cleanly. Activation behavior appears further refined with files like activationfunction.py and softmax.activation.py.

Because the repo is pure Python (100% per GitHub) and does not depend on external deep-learning frameworks, it provides a valuable learning tool for understanding how neural networks truly work “under the hood.” Rather than relying on high-level APIs, a user exploring this repo can trace step-by-step how inputs pass through layers, how activations are applied, how network outputs are compared to targets, and how losses are calculated — mirroring the conceptual explanation of feedforward and learning via loss minimization that underlie artificial neural networks.

Despite its clarity and educational value, the repository currently has no README, documentation, or usage examples. That makes it somewhat harder for a newcomer to quickly get started — there’s no guide on how to build a network, load data, train, or evaluate. Also, with just one commit and no branches or forks, the project appears nascent; it may lack robustness, testing, or coverage for edge-cases.

Overall, Python-Neural-Networks is a promising skeleton for educational experiments. It is particularly suited for learners who want to demystify neural-network internals and manually experiment — customizing activation functions, loss calculations, layers, or even building new architectures. With some added documentation and example scripts (data loading, training loops, test/evaluation), it could serve as a lightweight, framework-free alternative to popular tutorial repos.
